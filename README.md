# COMP 163 - Project 2: Character Abilities Showcase

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a simple character system that demonstrates mastery of object-oriented programming fundamentals: inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and composition. This project focuses on core OOP concepts without the complexity of a full game system.

## 📋 Getting Started

1. **Complete your implementation** in `project2_starter.py`
2. **Test your code** by running: `python project2_starter.py`
3. **Run automated tests** with: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. **Commit and push** to see GitHub test results

## 🏗️ What You're Building

### **Class Structure (6 Classes Total)**

```
Character (base class)
    ↓
Player (inherits from Character)  
    ↓
Warrior, Mage, Rogue (inherit from Player)

Weapon (composition - separate class)
```

### **Required Stats for Each Class:**

| Class   | Health | Strength | Magic | Special Ability |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Warrior | 120    | 15       | 5     | Power Strike    |
| Mage    | 80     | 8        | 20    | Fireball        |
| Rogue   | 90     | 12       | 10    | Sneak Attack    |

## 🎮 Core Functionality

### **All Characters Must Have:**
- `attack(target)` - Basic attack method
- `take_damage(damage)` - Reduce health
- `display_stats()` - Print character information

### **Players Additionally Have:**
- `character_class` attribute (like "Warrior", "Mage")
- `level` and `experience` attributes
- Enhanced `display_stats()` that shows player info

### **Special Abilities (Each Class):**
- **Warrior**: `power_strike(target)` - High damage attack
- **Mage**: `fireball(target)` - Magic damage attack
- **Rogue**: `sneak_attack(target)` - Critical hit attack

### **Weapons (Composition):**
- `Weapon(name, damage_bonus)` - Characters can HAVE weapons
- `display_info()` - Show weapon information

## ✅ Testing Your Code

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_inheritance.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_method_overriding.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_special_abilities.py -v

# Test your main program
python project2_starter.py
```

### **GitHub Testing**

After pushing your code, check the **Actions** tab to see automated test results:

- ✅ **Inheritance Tests** (20 points) - Class structure and inheritance chain
- ✅ **Method Overriding Tests** (20 points) - Polymorphism and customized methods
- ✅ **Special Abilities Tests** (15 points) - Character abilities and composition

## 🎮 Example Usage

Your program should work like this:

```python
# Create characters (inheritance)
warrior = Warrior("Marcus")
mage = Mage("Aria")  
rogue = Rogue("Shadow")

# Polymorphism - same method, different behavior
for character in [warrior, mage, rogue]:
    character.attack(target)  # Each attacks differently

# Special abilities
warrior.power_strike(enemy)
mage.fireball(enemy)
rogue.sneak_attack(enemy)

# Composition
sword = Weapon("Iron Sword", 15)
sword.display_info()

# Test battle system (provided for you)
battle = SimpleBattle(warrior, mage)
battle.fight()
```

## 🎲 SimpleBattle System (Provided)

You have a **SimpleBattle** class already written that you can use to test your characters:

```python
battle = SimpleBattle(character1, character2)
battle.fight()  # Simulates a simple battle
```

**⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY the SimpleBattle class** - it's provided for testing your implementations.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Protected Files**
- **DO NOT MODIFY** files in the `tests/` directory
- **DO NOT MODIFY** the `SimpleBattle` class
- Modifying protected files will result in automatic academic integrity violation

### **AI Usage Policy**
- ✅ **Allowed**: AI assistance for implementation, debugging, learning
- 📝 **Required**: Document AI usage in code comments
- 🎯 **Must be able to explain**: Every class and method during interview

## 🏆 Grading

- **Inheritance Tests (20%)**: Proper 3-level inheritance chain
- **Method Overriding (20%)**: Polymorphism and customized behaviors
- **Special Abilities (15%)**: Character-specific methods and composition
- **Code Quality (5%)**: Professional comments and documentation
- **Interview (40%)**: Code explanation and live coding

## 🎨 Bonus Creative Elements

Feel free to add your own creative touches for bonus points:
- Additional character classes beyond the three required
- More weapon types with different properties
- Enhanced special abilities with unique effects

## COMP 163 - Project 2: Character Showcase

This project creates a character system using Inheritance and Classes to showcase differe character stats and abilities. The project use Hierarchial Inheritence with the base class being Character and multiple derived classes Player which inherites from Character and the different character classes Warrior, Mage, and Rogue which inherite from Player. It also uses method overriding which is seen through Player overriding Character display_class() method and the character classes overriding the Player attack() method using super.

## Bonus Creativity Choices

In this project I decided to add the attributes level, experience, and gold to the program. With the starting values being 0, 0, and 100 these values update for the characters after the battle depending on the winner of the match. If the character is the winner then they will level up, gain 500 experience points, and gain 100 more gold. While the losing player gains 300 experience point, 50 gold, and does not level up until they win a match. I also made the character damage half of the character's strength. As well as the base attack for the character correspond with the Warrior for example the Rogue's highest attack is equal to the Warrior's base attack.

## AI Usage 

AI was used in this project to gain a general idea of what the code should look like or to explain why a particular code was not giving an expected output. At no point was any code copied and pasted into the program. All of the code was typed by hand by me. AI was also used to help format the README for better understanding and cohesiveness. 

## How To Run

To run the program save the python file as a .py file. 
Open the terminal and run: python project2.py
